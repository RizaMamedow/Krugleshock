The site will be expanded over time. <br></br> Now I'm studying mobile development. Quite familiar with web application development, especially in React and NextJS, and also well acquainted with creating backends and APIs in Django and django-rest-framework. <br></br> If you want to read about me, go to the 'about' section. and if you want to see my achievements, go to the 'certificates' section."

    "content": "My story is short. I am a guy from the town, I lived and was, but somehow there was an interest in IT. It probably started with games that I couldn't play because of the difficulty (Europa Universalis 4, etc.), well, in a single player game, I started using commands and digging into game configs, cheats, trainers, and so on. Well, I had a dream, like many others, to make my own game... <br></br> ... Well, well, I turned in the wrong direction because I ended up in Web programming. Okay in order. HTML is the first thing I learned. further CSS, Javascript, and python. I still write in Python. then there was a stagnation for about a year 2 could not find itself. Studied from the word 'everything!' Godot, Ruby, Go, C#, Flutter. But now I have chosen the main direction is Mobile development and Web development. <br></br> I did not immediately come to NextJS. I got my hands on React but I hated Javascript and now I write exclusively in Typescript because it's really a convenient thing. And NextJS is generally a cool framework! <br></br> I have learned Django well. The framework is robust, user-friendly, beautiful and stable, and Django has the best documentation I've seen. <br></br> That's all. that's all you need to know about me. my contacts below as well as the repository of this site follow the link.",
